# Array practice

Identify the time complexity of each of these functions with a 1 sentence
justification for your answer. Assume `arr` is an array of length _n_.

## `arr.push()`

Time complexity: O(1)
Space complexity: O(1)
Justification: Adding to the end of an array is a constant operation.

[push on MDN][push]


## `arr.pop()`

Time complexity: O(1)
Space complexity: O(1)
Justification: Removing from the end of an array is a constant operation.

[pop on MDN][pop]

## `arr.shift()`

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)
Justification: All elements must shift/move to the left by one.

[shift on MDN][shift]

## `arr.unshift()`

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)
Justification: All elements must shift/move to the right by one.

[unshift on MDN][unshift]

## `arr.splice()`

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)
Justification: All elements must shift to fill empty slots. A new array is returned.

[splice on MDN][splice]

## `arr.slice()`

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)
Justification: Must copy all elements individually. Returns new array.

[slice on MDN][slice]

## `arr.indexOf()`

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)
Justification: Worst case, target is not in array, must iterate through entire array to know. No new space is needed.

[indexOf on MDN][indexOf]

## `arr.map()`

Time complexity: O(n) ** cb is O(1) **
Space complexity: O(n)
Justification: Must iterate over entire array. Returns a new array.

[map on MDN][map]

## `arr.filter()`

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)
Justification: Must iterate over entire array. Returns a new array.

[filter on MDN][filter]

## `arr.reduce()`

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)
Justification: Must iterate over entire array. No new space is needed if only returning accumulator as an integer.

[reduce on MDN][reduce]

## `arr.reverse()`

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)
Justification: Must evaluate each element to move. This happens in place, no new memory is allocated.

[reverse on MDN][reverse]

## `[...arr]`

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)
Justification: It calls the array iteratorâ€™s .next() method successively until the iterator is exhausted. Returns deep copy of array.
